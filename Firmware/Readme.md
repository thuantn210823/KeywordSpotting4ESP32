Here is where you can directly download and refer. For compiler work, I used Arduino IDE. For TensorFlow Lite support library, I used EloquentTensorFlow32, you can find it here <https://github.com/eloquentarduino/EloquentTensorFlow32>. 
Each sketch was packed to folder with name of each specific experiment.

Besides KWS, I tried with WuW task and used Kaggle Alexa dataset for testing, you can find it here <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aanhari/alexa-dataset>.
