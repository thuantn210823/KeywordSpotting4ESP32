## Progress
Google Colab is my best friend during working with this project. Here is my journey, you can find it in the Progress folder. Each subfolder was named based on the week which I was working on. In there, most of notebooks was named with index, this marks the order you should follow.

## TensorFlow
It's the first time I used TensorFlow for deployment. The first thing I thought was that I had to know the most basic things of this framework. Most of them actually are tutorials provided by TensorFlow, and you can get them in the home page of TensorFlow. 

Besides TensorFlow, there also have my TensorFlow Lite learning process, you can take a look if you interest!
