## Process
Google Colab is my best friend during working with this project. Here is my journey, you can find it in the Process folder. Each subfolder was named for follow the week which I was working on. In there, most of notebooks was named with index, this marks the order you should follow.

## TensorFlow
It's the first time I used TensorFlow for deployment. The first thing I thought was that I had to know the most basic thing of this framework. Most of them actually are tutorials provided by TensorFlow, and you can get them in the home page of TensorFlow. But there was a lot of them in TensorFlow's homepage, and it is why I made this tutorial. It was made mostly based on my experience in using Deep Learning framework, this tutorial will give you at least you should know about TensorFlow.

Besides TensorFlow, there also have my TensorFlow Lite learning process, you can take a look if you interest!
